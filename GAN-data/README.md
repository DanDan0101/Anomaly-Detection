The data has been converted from the [LHCO2020](https://lhco2020.github.io/homepage/).

The .csv files have our high-level features. The first line in each file contains the column titles; the first column has no name and represents the index. We've dropped all rows with NaN values.

There are about 100k events in the Pythia Signal file, 1M events in the Pythia Background file, and 1M events in the Herwig Background file. The Herwig generation was done by Dr. Benjamin Nachman, who provided us with the high-level feature dataset.

Information about the nature of the signal can be found at the LHCO2020 link provided above.
